# Spelling-Bee-Game

This is a simple spelling game where the player listens to a word's definition and attempts to spell it correctly. The game randomly selects words from a provided dictionary file and uses text-to-speech synthesis to read out the word's definition.

Before running the game, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

    Python 3.12.2
    gtts library for text-to-speech synthesis (pip install gtts)
    nltk library for natural language processing (pip install nltk)

Additionally, make sure to download the WordNet corpus by running:

bash

python -m nltk.downloader wordnet
